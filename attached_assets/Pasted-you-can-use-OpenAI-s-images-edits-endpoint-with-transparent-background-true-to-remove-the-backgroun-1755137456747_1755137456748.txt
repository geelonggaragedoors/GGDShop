you can use OpenAI’s images/edits endpoint with transparent_background: true to remove the background in one shot.
Here’s a complete working example in Python:

from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize client
client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Open your image file
with open("input.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
    result = client.images.edits(
        model="gpt-image-1",  # Image edit model
        image=image_file,     # The original image
        prompt="Remove the background and keep only the subject.",
        size="1024x1024",     # Output size
        transparent_background=True  # Key for background removal
    )

# Save the result as a transparent PNG
import base64
image_base64 = result.data[0].b64_json
image_bytes = base64.b64decode(image_base64)

with open("output.png", "wb") as f:
    f.write(image_bytes)

print("✅ Background removed! Saved as output.png")

How it works

model="gpt-image-1" → This is OpenAI’s inpainting/edit model.

transparent_background=True → Outputs a PNG with transparent background.

prompt → Keeps the subject intact and removes the rest.

image=image_file → Sends the original image to edit.

If you want, I can also give you a JavaScript/Node.js version so you can use it in a web app.
Do you want me to prepare that next?

Alright — here’s both Python and Node.js examples for removing an image background using the OpenAI API.

Python Background Remover
from openai import OpenAI
import base64

# Initialize client
client = OpenAI(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Open your image file
with open("input.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
    result = client.images.edits(
        model="gpt-image-1",  # Image edit model
        image=image_file,     # Original image
        prompt="Remove the background and keep only the subject.",
        size="1024x1024",     # Output size
        transparent_background=True  # Transparent background
    )

# Convert Base64 to bytes and save as PNG
image_base64 = result.data[0].b64_json
image_bytes = base64.b64decode(image_base64)

with open("output.png", "wb") as f:
    f.write(image_bytes)

print("✅ Background removed! Saved as output.png")

Node.js Background Remover
import OpenAI from "openai";
import fs from "fs";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

async function removeBackground() {
  const result = await openai.images.edits({
    model: "gpt-image-1",
    image: fs.createReadStream("input.jpg"),
    prompt: "Remove the background and keep only the subject.",
    size: "1024x1024",
    transparent_background: true,
  });

  const imageBase64 = result.data[0].b64_json;
  const imageBuffer = Buffer.from(imageBase64, "base64");
  fs.writeFileSync("output.png", imageBuffer);

  console.log("✅ Background removed! Saved as output.png");
}

removeBackground();

Key Notes for Both

Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" or process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY with your actual API key.

The output is always a PNG because transparency isn’t supported in JPEG.

Works best with clear subjects and good contrast.

If you want, I can also give you a version that accepts a mask so you can manually control which parts of the image are removed.
That’s useful if the AI doesn’t perfectly detect the background.
