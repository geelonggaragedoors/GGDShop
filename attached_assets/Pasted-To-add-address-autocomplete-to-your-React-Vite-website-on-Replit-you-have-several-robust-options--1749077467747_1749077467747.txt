To add address autocomplete to your React + Vite website on Replit, you have several robust options. The most common and reliable approach is to use the Google Places Autocomplete API, but alternatives like Mapbox or GeoPostcodes also exist. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:

## **1. Choose Your Autocomplete Provider**

- **Google Places API**: Industry standard, global coverage, highly accurate.
- **Mapbox**: Good for global coverage, offers free tier.
- **GeoPostcodes**: Useful if you want to host your own address data, but requires backend setup[6][7].

For most use cases, Google Places API is the easiest to integrate and offers the best user experience.

## **2. Get an API Key**

- Sign up for a Google Cloud account.
- Enable the “Places API” and “Maps JavaScript API.”
- Generate an API key and restrict it to your domain for security[2][6].

## **3. Install an Autocomplete React Component**

You can either use a ready-made React component or build your own using the API.

### **Option A: Use a Ready-Made NPM Package**

#### **react-google-autocomplete**
- Install via npm:
  ```
  npm install react-google-autocomplete
  ```
- Usage example:
  ```jsx
  import Autocomplete from "react-google-autocomplete";

  function MyForm() {
    return (
       {
          // Extract address components from 'place'
          console.log(place);
        }}
        options={{
          types: ["address"],
          fields: ["address_components", "geometry", "formatted_address"],
        }}
      />
    );
  }
  ```
- This component handles loading the Google Maps script and provides address suggestions as the user types[2].

#### **places-autocomplete-react**
- Install via npm:
  ```
  npm install places-autocomplete-react
  ```
- Usage example:
  ```jsx
  import AutoComplete from 'places-autocomplete-react';

  function App() {
    return (
       console.log(addressObject)}
        required={true}
      />
    );
  }
  ```
- This is another simple, reusable component for address autocomplete[5].

### **Option B: Build Your Own Component**

If you want more control, you can use the Google Maps JavaScript API directly:
- Load the Google Maps script with the Places library.
- Attach `google.maps.places.Autocomplete` to your input field.
- Listen for the `place_changed` event to extract address details[1][3][6].

Example:
```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react";

function AddressAutocomplete({ onPlaceSelect }) {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!window.google) return;
    const autocomplete = new window.google.maps.places.Autocomplete(inputRef.current, {
      types: ["address"],
      fields: ["address_components", "geometry", "formatted_address"],
    });
    autocomplete.addListener("place_changed", () => {
      onPlaceSelect(autocomplete.getPlace());
    });
  }, []);

  return ;
}
```
This approach gives you full flexibility but requires manual script loading and API management[1][3][6].

## **4. Integrate with Your React + Vite App**

- If you use Vite, make sure your component or library is compatible with ES Modules.
- Add your chosen component to your form.
- Handle the selected address data in your form state.

## **5. Test on Replit**

- Ensure your API key is not exposed in public repositories.
- Test the autocomplete functionality to verify address suggestions and data extraction.

## **6. Optional: Consider Alternatives**

- **Mapbox**: Offers a similar autocomplete API and React integration[7].
- **GeoPostcodes**: If you want a self-hosted or privacy-focused solution, follow their guide to set up a backend and connect it to your React frontend[6].

> **Summary**:  
For a React + Vite site on Replit, the fastest way is to use a package like `react-google-autocomplete` or `places-autocomplete-react`, supply your Google API key, and handle the selected address in your form. This minimizes code and setup while delivering a professional user experience[2][5][6].
