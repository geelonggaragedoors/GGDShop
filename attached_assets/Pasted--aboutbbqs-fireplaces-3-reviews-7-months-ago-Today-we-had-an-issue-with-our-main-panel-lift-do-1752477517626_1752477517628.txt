Today we had an issue with our main panel lift door. We called another company and the guy that answered said he couldn't do anything to help us until after Christmas (about 6 weeks away) so we declined and called Geelong Garage Doors. The gentleman that answered the phone did his best to rectify our problem over the phone and then quickly offered to have a technician come to our house within the hour. The technician arrived promptly, Dave, arrived in less than an hour and was quick to assist. The door was fixed and working again quickly and Dave also checked everything was working correctly and lubricated the door and tracks. 100% happy and very well priced. Thanks!

Sent email enquiries to 3 Geelong Roller door companies on Saturday, after the old roller door motor finally died.
First thing this morning Steve called me and offered a competitive price on a new motor and door service and said they could install it today. Laurie, their installer was a lovely and polite gentleman who got the job done in a couple of hours.
He explained the warranty and operation.
I didn't even get a price from the other companies in the end.
But based on their customer service and professionalism, I would highly recommend these guys.

Great follow up service today from Pam, then David when we had some issues with our double panel door. David has a lovely manner and was quick to put me at ease when I thought I had broken the door. Everything is now good as gold. Thanks guys.

The service at Geelong Garage Doors is fantastic. I called them Tuesday and explained to Steve my double sectional door had not closed fully the previous night, leaving plenty of room for someone to slide under and then have access to the house through the internal door. A very sleepless night listening for intruders. I was upset and worried about spending another night like that. Steve said someone would be out to fix it in an hour or so. David arrived happy and smiling, fixed the door, and made my day. Thank you guys. Professional and Caring. A 5 Star business. Highly recommend.

I bought a $55 item from their online store which proved to be incompatible with my garage door opener. After calling their office and explaining that the part supplied was a Version 4 while the listing stated it was a version 5, I was told that I would be sent a return label, and my purchase would be refunded. The promised return label never arrived so I decided to drive the 115 KM and attend their showroom in person to return the item for my promised refund.

Much to my surprise I was informed that I was never promised a return label nor a refund and that it was my fault for misinterpreting the listing and therefore I would not be getting a refund.

I demonstrated that the current listing for the same item on their online store was ambiguous at best and misleading at worst as it still made reference to Version 5 in the item description, and I felt that they could make a goodwill gesture and provide a refund.

This was flatly refused, and I informed them that they left me with no other option but to raise a dispute with PayPal and share my customer service experience via Google reviews and left the showroom.

I took what turned out to be a very timely screenshot of the listing for my PayPal claim as shortly after I left the showroom the listing was modified and any reference to Version 5 was removed.

I received a call about an hour after leaving and was offered a refund less a restocking fee which I politely refused.
I received a full refund the day after lodging my claim with PayPal.

I am happy to return the item once I receive the promised return label.

So that's Five stars for PayPal and One star for Geelong Garage Doors.

I paid the 50% deposit (over $2,000) on January 29th and was told it would be about two weeks until the door was manufactured and job was done. I was told I’d get a call when the door was received. …More

Great communication from the team at the office. Laurie (I think was the serviceman's name) was a dead set legend. Had the problem sorted, solved (a new motor) in about 30 minutes. Old school charm and service.

Don't use the online service request they don't receive them. My garage door was stuck open so I sent a request rang after 4 days and they suggested I ring someone else as they couldn't get out for another week.

Hi Christine,
As per our phone conversation we sometimes may experience issues with our online bookings however we have had our IT guy working on this issue recently to make sure it is back up and running.
Upon further investigation we did receive your request that was sent in over the long weekend(when we were closed) and it was replied to using the email address that you provided first thing Monday morning to let you know that we were unable to attend your address this week and were good enough to recommend another trusted local garage door business who may have been able to assist you quicker as you a were in an emergency situation where your garage door was stuck in the open position.
As we value honesty and good customer service, we prefer not to lead our customers on and be upfront if we are experiencing longer lead times than usual to avoid disappointment.
On this occasion we feel that the one star review is unwarranted and we would appreciate it if you would rethink you review as we believe we have been as helpful as possible in this situation.
