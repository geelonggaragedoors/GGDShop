# File Uploads For Developers

UploadThing is the easiest way to add file uploads to your full stack TypeScript
application. Many services have tried to build a "better S3", but in our
opinion, none found the right compromise of ownership, flexibility and safety.

## Getting started

To get started, create a new application on the
[UploadThing Dashboard ↗](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard/new) and grab an API
key from the API Keys tab. Then select your framework to learn how to integrate
UploadThing in your application in minutes.

## [Frameworks](https://docs.uploadthing.com/\#frameworks)

Using a fullstack framework makes integrating UploadThing a breeze. No matter what framework you use, there's a good chance we have a first party adapter for it.
