# JavaScript SDK script configuration

The JavaScript SDK displays relevant, PayPal-supported payment methods on your page, giving your buyers a personalized and streamlined checkout experience.



## Add the SDK 
You can integrate the SDK in a script tag or as a module:

 

### Script tag
You can add the SDK in a script tag. This loads the main object PayPal to the global window scope of the browser. Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID with your client ID.


**info**
Note:Load the JavaScript SDK directly from https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js . Don't include it in a bundle or host it yourself. For more information, see [Load the JavaScript SDK from the PayPal server](https://developer.paypal.com/sdk/js/performance/#link-loadthejavascriptsdkfromthepaypalserver/) .



#### **`Sample script tag`**
```javascript
<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID"></script>
```

### Module
You can use the SDK as a module. Loading the SDK as a module brings certain advantages, especially when working with a [JavaScript framework](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/standard/customize/single-page-app/) . For example, you can optimize performance because the module lets you control loading behavior in JavaScript instead of HTML. It can also help reduce bugs by encapsulating data.

- Use the **paypal-js**  [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paypal/paypal-js) to integrate with front-end tools.
- Use the **react-paypal-js**  [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@paypal/react-paypal-js) within the React.js framework.


#### **`Use the paypal-js npm package to integrate with front-end tools`**
```javascript
import { loadScript } from "@paypal/paypal-js";
loadScript({ "client-id": YOUR_CLIENT_ID })
.then((paypal) => {
    // start to use the PayPal JS SDK script
})
.catch((err) => {
    console.error("failed to load the PayPal JS SDK script", err);
});
```


#### **`Use the react-paypal-js npm package within the React.js framework`**
```javascript
import { PayPalScriptProvider } from "@paypal/react-paypal-js";
export default function App() {
    return (
        <PayPalScriptProvider options={{ "client-id": YOUR_CLIENT_ID }}/>
    );
}
```

You can configure and customize your integration by passing query parameters and script parameters in the JavaScript SDK script tag. These parameters personalize your setup and help PayPal decide the optimal funding sources and buttons to show to your buyers.

 

### Query parameters
Query parameters help define specific content or actions based on the data being passed. Each piece of data you send contains the following:

- A key-value pair. Keys define the piece of information needed, and the value provides that information. The key is separated from the value by an equal sign ( = ).
- A question mark ( ? ) to signify the beginning of the key-value pairs in the query string.
- Ampersands ( & ) if you need to provide more than 1 set of values at a time.
- Information that PayPal needs to handle your request.

In this example, you send your authorization and components as query parameters:


#### **`Query parameters`**
```javascript
<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&components=card-fields"></script>
```

### Script parameters
Script parameters are additional key value pairs you can add to the script tag to provide information you need for your site to work, a single-use token, or information you'd like to capture on a page for analytics reasons.

For example, a token that identifies your buyer:


#### **`Script parameters`**
```javascript
<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" data-client-token="abc123xyz=="></script>
```


## Query parameters 
Use test parameters to see JavaScript SDK results. If you don't pass a parameter, the default value is used.


### client-ID
The client-ID identifies the PayPal account that sets up and finalizes transactions. By default, funds from any transactions are settled into this account. If you are facilitating transactions on behalf of other merchants and capturing funds into their accounts, see merchant-ID .

| Example value | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| test | none | Your PayPal REST client ID. This identifies your PayPal account, and determines where any transactions are paid to. While you're testing in sandbox, you can useclient-id=sbas a shortcut. |


#### **`client-ID`**
```javascript
<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID">
 </script>
```

### buyer-country
The buyer country determines which funding sources are eligible for a given buyer. Defaults to the buyer's IP geolocation. Any country that you can pass as a locale is a valid buyer country.

Note:The buyer country is only used in the sandbox. Don't pass this query parameter in production.

| Example value | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| US,CA,GB,DE,FR | automatic | The buyer country. Available in the sandbox for testing. |


#### **`buyer-country`**
```javascript
<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&buyer-country=US">
</script>
```

### commit
The commit status of the transaction. Determines whether to show a **Pay Now** or **Continue** button in the Checkout flow.

- Use the **Pay Now** button when the buyer completes payment on the PayPal review page. For example, digitally-delivered items without shipping costs.
- Use the **Continue** button when the buyer completes payment on your site to account for shipping, tax, and other items before submitting the order.

Important:When you integrate with a PayPal API, make sure the commit value you pass in the API call matches the value you pass in the JavaScript call.

| Example value | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| true,false | true | Set to true if the transaction is completed on the PayPal review page or false if the amount captured changes after the buyer returns to your site. Not applicable for subscriptions.

- true shows a **Pay Now** button in the PayPal Checkout flow. The final amount doesn't change after the buyer returns from PayPal to your site.
- false shows a **Continue** button in the PayPal Checkout flow. The final amount might change after the buyer returns from PayPal to your site due to shipping, taxes, or other fees, the final amount. |


#### **`commit`**
```javascript
<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&commit=false">
</script>
```

### components
The PayPal components you intend to render on your page. Each component you use must be separated by a comma ( , ). If you don't pass any components, the default payment buttons component automatically renders all eligible buttons in a single location on your page.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| buttons | Places all of the eligible checkout buttons on your page. |
| marks | Presents other funding sources on your page alongside PayPal using[radio buttons](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/standard/customize/display-payment-methods/). |

| funding-eligibility | Allows you to choose the individual payment buttons (methods) you want to display on your web page. |
| hosted-fields | Shows your own hosted credit and debit card fields. |
| applepay | Displays the Apple Pay button |

### integration-date
The integration date of the script, passed as a YYYY-MM-DD value. Defaults to the date when your client ID was created, which reflects the date that you added the PayPal integration to your site. This parameter ensures backwards compatibility.

- Your site automatically gets any backward-compatible changes made to the PayPal script.
- These changes include: - New funding sources
- Buttons
- Updated user interfaces
- Bug fixes
- Security fixes
- Performance optimizations

 
- You don't need to change the integration-date to enable new features.
- Your site doesn't get any backward incompatible updates made to the PayPal script after the specified integration-date , or after the date your client-id was created, if you don't pass the integration-date parameter.
- If your client-id doesn't change, you can omit the integration-date parameter and the script will maintain backward compatibility.
- If your client-id changes dynamically, you must pass an integration date, which ensures that no breaking changes are made to your integration. This could be the case if you build a cart app, which enables merchants to dynamically set a client ID to add PayPal to their store.

| Example value | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2018-11-30 | automatic | The date of integration. Used to ensure backwards compatibility. |


#### **`integration-date`**

<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&integration-date=2018-11-07"></script>
```

### intent
The intent for the transaction. This determines whether the funds are captured immediately while the buyer is present on the page. Defaults to capture .

**Important:** When you integrate with a PayPal API, make sure the intent value you pass in the API call matches the value you pass in the JavaScript call.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| capture | The funds are captured immediately while the buyer is present on your site. |
| authorize | The funds are authorized immediately and then reauthorized or captured later. |
| subscription | Used along withvault=trueto specify this is a subscription transaction. |

#### **`intent`**
```javascript
<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&intent=authorize"></script>
```
**Intent options when integrating with older APIs**

When you integrate the JavaScript SDK with an older API like the [Orders V1](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/orders/v1/) REST API or one of our NVP/SOAP solutions, you can use the following options:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| captureorsale | The funds are captured immediately while the buyer is present on your site. The value you use should match theintentvalue in the API call. |
| authorize | The funds are authorized immediately and then reauthorized or captured later. |
| order | The funds are validated without an authorization and you can reauthorize or capture later. |


### locale
The locale renders components. By default PayPal detects the correct locale for the buyer based on their geolocation and browser preferences. It is recommended to pass this parameter only if you need the PayPal buttons to render in the same language as the rest of your site.

| Example value | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| en_US,fr_FR,de_DO | automatic | The locale used to localize any components. PayPal recommends not setting this parameter, as the buyer's locale is automatically set by PayPal. |


#### **`locale`**
